## Documentation  

1. The program is still not responsive, it will only perform well on the device with the screen below the 4, 5inch.  
2. All computing will be done based on his mathematical priorities.  
3. Any input would be converted into decimal base before operated, then after the operation is completed the results will be changed again into a base of eighteen
